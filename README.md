What is Git versus GitHub? Git is a revision control system, a tool to manage your source code history. Where GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories.

Once in Github if you click on new repository a digital directory or storage space where you can access your project, its files, and all the viersion of its files that Git saves.

You can edit your repositories using github and/or through a command line interface. while using a command line interface if you run 'git clone' command the existing repository will be targeted and clone will be created or in other words a copy of the targeted repository.

When you change a file in your repository a commit should be made, which means to save your changes. Doing this will help a user keep track and record of the changes that were made when and by who.

A remote repository are used for collaboration/group work, where all team memebrs use to exchange their changes. There is a command "push" that is used to upload local repository conent to a remote repository. Pushing is how a user tansfer the commits from the local repository to the remote repository.

A git Pull command on the otherhand is used to update the local version on a repository from a remote. A pull command does two things, it updates the current local working branch. and updates the remote tracking branches for all other branches. A branch in git is a lightweight movable pointer to a commit. the git branch command lets a user create, list, rename, and delete brnches.

Merging in Git is Git's way of putting a forked history back together again. The git merge command lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch. A merge conflict happens when a user merges branches that have competing commits, and Git needs the user to decide which changes to incorperate in the final merge.

A git fetch is a primary command used to download contents from a remote repository and is a critical piece of collaborative git work flows.

What is Git versus GitHub? Git is a revision control system, a tool to manage your source code history. Where GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories.

Once in Github if you click on new repository a digital directory or storage space where you can access your project, its files, and all the viersion of its files that Git saves.

You can edit your repositories using github and/or through a command line interface. while using a command line interface if you run 'git clone' command the existing repository will be targeted and clone will be created or in other words a copy of the targeted repository.

When you change a file in your repository a commit should be made, which means to save your changes. Doing this will help a user keep track and record of the changes that were made when and by who.
